# Boot Camp Homework 19 - News Search and Saver using React js

This intends to search the New York Times for articles according to the user's entries in a search form.  The form allows search by headline keywords and time period (start and end year).  It queries the NYT API for the top 5 results and displays those results onscreen.  Each search result gives the option to save that article.  Saved articles are stored on a mongo database and are shown onscreen at the bottom of the page.  Saved articles have the option to be removed from storage.  

Node modules used:
- body-parser
- express
- mongoose
- morgan
- react
- react-dom
- react-router
- react-bootstrap

Comment: At time of turn-in this app is not completed.  I was not able to get a clean transpile and some functionality is not yet coded.
